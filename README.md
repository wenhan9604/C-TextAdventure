# C-TextAdventure

Hey all! This is a repo to store the codes I've learnt in Codecademy on C++!

This exercise is about text adventure - creating different possible scenarios and outcomes based on user inputs. We were tasked to use if/else if statements, loops (mainly for loops instead of while loops because of Codecademy restriction). Enjoy the the text adventure!
